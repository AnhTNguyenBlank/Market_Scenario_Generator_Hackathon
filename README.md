# Market Scenario Generator Hackathon: From Stability to Storms

Most of what in here can be found in the competition, I only added works, results and other parts.
In this file, you can find:

* My submission model, parameters and data file,
* Since I do not know which stocks they are using for the competition, I use YahooFinance to take more stocks and replicate the competition for my own researches.
